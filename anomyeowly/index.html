				<h2>Story</h2>
				<p>You’re in trouble.</p>
				<p>You can’t find the exit of the café.</p>
				<p>Even when you leave, you end up back at the entrance.</p>
				<p>You're stuck in the cat cafe, and a cat-eared maid approaches you.</p>
				<p>"Ah… are you trying to get out of here too?</p>
				<p>Even if you leave through the exit, you end up back at the entrance, right?</p>
				<p>I was stuck just like you… I can’t believe I’ve met someone in the same situation!</p>
				<p>Since we’ve run into each other, I’ll share the ‘rules for escaping’ that the cats taught me.</p>
				<p>‘If something feels meow-strange, turn back.</p>
				<p>If it doesn’t feel meow-strange, keep going forward.</p>
				<p>And if you fix an anomaly, go forward too.’</p>
				<p>A kind cat taught me those rules, but honestly… they’re too tricky for me, and, well, here I am.</p>
				<p>So I want you to find the exit that I couldn’t… nya."</p>

				<h2>Game Content</h2>
				<p>What is an anomyeowly?</p>
				<p>Sometimes strange things happen in this place.</p>
				<p>For example... the cat is wearing a strange hat, or the cat suddenly breaks a plate...</p>
				<p>The 10 cats you just saw increase to 11...</p>
				<p>A variety of anomalies await you, from hilarious cat pranks to shocking horror traps.</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>If you encounter such an unusual "anomaly," turn back.</p>
				<p>But if there is no "anomaly," just keep going forward.</p>
				<p>And if you fix an anomary, you can move forward.</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>It seems the Anomaly Mode won't be deactivated unless the 10 cats are satisfied.</p>
				<p>It seems that the cats' anger is causing the anomalies.</p>
				<p>Now it's up to you to uncover the anomalies in this looping cat café, with the cat-eared maid.</p>
